# GPEDA - Gaussian Process sampling EDA algorithm (name subject to change )

Optimization method combining ideas of Efficient Global Optimization algorithm by Jones et. al and the 
estimation of distribution algorithms. More details will be added to this readme later on.

## Using the package

To use functions from the package you first need to run the startup script with

```matlab
  run src/startup.m
```

This also initializes the GPML package.

### Running an optimization

### File structure

The package code itself is located in the `src` directory. The experiment scripts for testing
various pieces or whatever should go into the `exp` directory.
